SAMPLE SQL QUERIES:

1) List all questions for topic "Database Fundamentals" with difficulty level 5;

SQL>   SELECT DISTINCT qid,question from question,topic where question.topicid = (SELECT tid from topic where tname = 'Database Fundamentals') AND qlevel = 5;

2) Add a question for topic "Security and Authorization"; (login as "Kogan")

Login as "kogan" is a part which is handled by the front-end java program.The SQL Query for adding a question "abc?" for topic "Security and Authorization" is as follows:

FRONT END OUTPUT:

//SQL QUERY

SQL> INSERT INTO question(qid,topicid,question,qlevel) VALUES ('q21',(SELECT tid from topic where tname = 'Security and Authorization'),'abc?','5');

Note: When running through the front-end, "qid" is assigned by a code running in our program and need not be entered by the faculty.

3)Show me my first attempt of HW1 for csc440 spring 2013. (login as "Rjoseph")


SQL> Select q_id,question,answer,score,right_answer from question,storage where storage.q_id = question.qid AND stud_id = 'Rjoseph' AND ex_id = 'e1' AND attempt_no = 1;
 SAMPLE OUTPUT:
q_id question	answer	  score	 right_answer
q1	 abc	    jkl	     	0	  def
q3	 def		ghi			0	  pqr
q5	 jkl		mno			0	  def
q8	 stu		vwx			3	  vwx
q10	 yz			mno			0	  pqr


4)Add a question for topic "Database Fundamentals" (Login as "Agholak"). This operation should fail.

Answer) The mechanism for login is handled by the front-end. "Agholak" is not a registered faculty and hence, an authentication error occurs as follows:


OUTPUT:
//Program started:


Connecting to database...
JDBC connected successfully
 
1 Login
2 Create User
3 Exit
Enter your choice: 1
 
Enter your username: Agholak
Enter password: qwerty

Invalid Username / password. Try again.
